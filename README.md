# PROJECT: RESTAURANT PAGE

>**A simple, dynamically rendered restaurant homepage.**

The main goal of this project is to practice `DOM manipulation` & to understand the importance of modularized code and manage these different modules using [`webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/).

This is one of the JavaScript projects recommended by [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/) and [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
